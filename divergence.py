#1. Observations
#Oscillatory Patterns:

#The red and blue regions indicate alternating divergence values (positive and negative), corresponding to the oscillatory nature of the terms.
#The spatial and temporal periodicity aligns with the frequencies used (
#𝑛
#𝜔
#nω).
#Damping Effects:

#The amplitude of the divergence seems to diminish as time (
#𝑡
#t) progresses, which is consistent with the exponential damping factor 
#𝑒
#−
#𝛾

#e 
#−γt
# .
#Symmetry:

#The symmetry between red and blue regions suggests that the divergence oscillates around zero, potentially leading to cancellation over a full cycle.
#Stability:

#There are no visible runaway solutions or chaotic regions, indicating that the damping successfully suppresses high-frequency contributions.
#2. Key Insights
#Divergence Minimization:

#The alternating pattern shows that the divergence fluctuates but does not grow unbounded, confirming stability.
#Over time, the divergence appears to approach zero as damping reduces the contributions of higher-order oscillatory terms.
#Physical Implications:

#The decaying oscillations suggest that any transient effects caused by the oscillatory terms would smooth out over cosmological timescales.
#This aligns with the need for large-scale energy densities to stabilize in observable cosmology.
#Numerical Validation:

#The results support the hypothesis that
